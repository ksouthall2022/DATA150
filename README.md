# Introduction

Hi everyone! My name is Kaori Southall. My name is pronounced kah-oh-rhee south-ohl.

I transferred to William & Mary from Tidewater Community College in the fall of 2020. I am a junior studying psychological science with a minor in religious studies. I have been very interested in the intersection between psychology and religion and becoming a psychotherapist/clinical psychologist and intent to practice in both the United States and Japan in order to serve clients with mental, emotional, and behavioral problems through more unique and creative ways and provide treatment plans.

I was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, and moved to the United States in the March of 2014. I am married to a loving husband and blessed with two sons. I worked in Japan-based Guthy Renker, is one of the largest and respected direct marketing companies in the world, for seven years. I was in charge of collaborating with customs officials and global freight companies to ensure compliance with regulations of the origin and destination; issuing all required documents to be along with the shipment to move smoothly (Invoice/Packing list/Bill of Lading); adjusting arrival schedule in port and warehouses; managing inventory for over fifty items including ordering and carrier management; location selection for the Proactiv cosmetic vending machines.

I am very passionate about many things. I really want to join a choir and explore the national parks in the United States! My favorite groups are The Drums, The 1975, The La's, Katy Perry, Phoenix and so on:)
